## Customization
The game displayed here is the final result created as an inclass demonstration led by the instructor.

## Hosting and Usability Testing
A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <https://spcgames.github.io/slider/>. Students were then required to find two volunteers and have each perform a usability test. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file and the usability test results, along with a link to the actual game for grading.
