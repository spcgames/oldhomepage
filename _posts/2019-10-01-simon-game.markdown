## Project Description
The second project for DGIM 2530 - Game Design 1 creates a Simon Says Game using Tumult Hype. The project utilizes audio, which is triggered by timelines, difficulty level options on the initial page, as well as badges for level completion. 

----
## Customization
The game displayed here is the final result created as an inclass demonstration led by the instructor. Students were then given two weeks to modify the layout, audio, badges, colors, typography and other elements. 

----
## Hosting and Usability Testing
A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <https://spcgames.github.io/simon/>. Students were then required to find two volunteers and have each perform a usability test. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file and the usability test results, along with a lin to the actual game for grading.
